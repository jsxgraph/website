Dear friends of JSXGraph,

JSXGraph v1.11.1 is a patch release that addresses a few subtle bugs.

The update includes fixes for the following issues:

- Removing 3D objects is now handled correctly, resolving a potential issue that may have caused unexpected behavior.
- Setting certain attribute values has been improved.
- The handling of the null color value has been updated to properly support transparency, again.

Enjoy, Alfred
