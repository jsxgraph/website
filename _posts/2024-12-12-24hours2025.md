Dear friends of JSXGraph,

JSXGraph will have its first open live event! We invite everybody to join us on __February 26./27, 2025__ at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. The aim is to bring JSXGraph users together for two days to get to know each other, network, learn from each other, discuss and work together. 

All participants are invited to introduce themselves with a very short presentation, after which we will split up into working groups. We see this meeting as an opportunity for beginners to delve deeper into programming with JSXGraph. The new possibilities of the current version v1.11 will also be presented. 

The event will take place at the University of Bayreuth. It begins on February 26th around noon and ends on February 27th in the early afternoon. A joint dinner is planned for the evening of February 26th. The meeting is free of charge, more information and registration at <https://jsxgraph.org/24hours2025/>. Hotel prices in Bayreuth are reasonable, if you are looking for recommendations, please contact us.

Best regards, 

Carsten Miller and Alfred Wassermann (Organizers)
