Dear friends of JSXGraph,

We are very happy to announce the release of JSXGraph v1.10.0!

This release improves mainly JSXGraph's 3D functionality. For example, it is now  possible to drag 3D lines defined by two points and the `view3d` the attribute `axesPosition:'border'` is now working. The latter implied that there are new elements `text3d` and `ticks3d`.

Other notable news are, that there is a new (2D) element `tangentto` which also to construct a tangent through a given point to a circle or conic section. With "Pareto distribution" there is one more type of random numbers and the cumulative version of the function has been corrected.

The stability of implicit curve plotting could be improved and that element has now
additional (optional) parameters `rangex` and `rangey`. As always, quite a few bugs could be fixed (see the CHANGELOG for details) and the API docs has been extended and updated.

Many thanks to all contributors, sending patches and bug reports. Your work is very much appreciated.

Finally, do not forget to register for 5th JSXGraph conference on October 8-10, 2024 (online and free). The conference homepage is <https://jsxgraph.org/conf2024/>. Among many interesting presentations, there will be a workshop for beginners.

Enjoy, 

Carsten Miller, Andreas Walter, and Alfred Wassermann
